# [UI Design Daily](https://www.uidesigndaily.com/) - Open Source UI Design

This is the official repository for the open-source UI design website [uidesigndaily.com](https://www.uidesigndaily.com)

## About

The designs on the website are created by [Ildiko](https://twitter.com/Ildiesign). She's been creating a UI a day since March 2016. Over the years, she shared over 1400 designs with the community.

The code and infra are put together by Andrei.

## Repo Information

The `main` branch contains the code currently running in production. This is the original prototype created in 2020 to serve as a platform for sharing the designs.

The code in the `main` branch can be considered legacy going forward, as it would be too much hassle to do a gradual migration to the desired stack, while also developing the new features that we're aiming for.

**The `develop` branch contains the code for the new platform.**
